# luxarch:admin-bootstrap-cli asset v3 - DO NOT edit this marker line; it is how repo.emitted_assets_current knows your copy is current. Re-emit with `luxarch --emit admin-bootstrap-cli`.
"""The two non-request owners of the admin bootstrap: the startup hook and the recovery CLI.

`luxarch --emit admin-bootstrap-cli`. Drop this in at `app/cli.py`. The standard is
`luxarch --doc FLEET-ADMIN-BOOTSTRAP-STANDARD`.

    docker compose exec app python -m app.cli reset-password <login>

prints a random temporary password ONCE and sets `must_change_password`, so the owner signs in with
it and is sent straight to the change form. Being able to run a command inside the container is the
proof of ownership; no email is involved, because a self-hosted box often has no mail at all.

The reset is on record where the owner looks later: the command configures the fleet logging
(`luxarch --emit logging`) and sends its lines to the container's log, so `docker logs` (or
`docker compose logs`) shows the `password_reset_to_temporary` line with the login it reset, and no
password or hash. A `docker exec` command is not the container's main process, so its own output
reaches only the terminal that ran it; the container's log is PID 1's output. Where that cannot be
opened (off a container, or as a user who cannot open PID 1's output) the line stays on this
command's output and stderr says the container's log has no record.

`bootstrap_on_startup()` is what the app's lifespan awaits. It is a separate transaction owner (it
runs before any request), like the CLI, so list `app/cli.py` in `[allowlist].non_request_files`.
